# CureCademy-Game
A short and little C# game that has the player try to guess the illness of the patient by conducting limited tests, this is my first complete game on C# so constructed criticism is encouraged!

# DISCLAIMER
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TAGS DID IN GITHUB SO I DIDNT MAKE ONE FOR v1.0.0 im sorry!
I can not gurantee that I will keep updating this project, however I will try my best to do so, if you find anything of note that breaks the game completely, please let me know and I will try to fix that asap
